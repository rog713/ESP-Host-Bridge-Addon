# ESP Host Bridge

ESP Host Bridge is a local Web UI and USB CDC agent for ESP display devices.

It runs on the host, reads local metrics, and sends compact updates to the ESP over serial.

## What it does

- local Web UI on port `8654`
- managed agent process
- USB CDC transport to the ESP device
- local host metrics such as CPU, memory, network, disk, and temperature
- optional Docker and VM polling
- optional direct Web UI password protection

## Web UI

## Also Available

If you want the Home Assistant add-on instead of the standalone Linux install, use the packaging target in:

- `homeassistant_addon/`

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS
- Python 3.9+
- a connected ESP device over USB serial

## Install

Clone the repository and install it from the project root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rog713/ESP-Host-Bridge.git
cd ESP-Host-Bridge
python3 -m pip install .
```

For Ubuntu bootstrap install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rog713/ESP-Host-Bridge/main/install-ubuntu.sh | sudo bash
```

Rerunning the installer on Ubuntu upgrades the files in place and restarts the service if it is already running.

To install into your home directory instead of `/opt/esp-host-bridge`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rog713/ESP-Host-Bridge/main/install-ubuntu.sh | \
  sudo ESP_HOST_BRIDGE_INSTALL_DIR=/home/$USER/esp-host-bridge ESP_HOST_BRIDGE_USER=$USER bash
```

For macOS bootstrap install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rog713/ESP-Host-Bridge/main/install-mac.sh | bash
```

The macOS installer:

- installs into `~/Applications/esp-host-bridge` by default
- creates a virtual environment in that directory
- stores config in `~/Library/Application Support/ESP Host Bridge/config.json`
- installs a user LaunchAgent unless `ESP_HOST_BRIDGE_ENABLE_LAUNCH_AGENT=0`

Optional Homebrew tools can be installed during bootstrap:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rog713/ESP-Host-Bridge/main/install-mac.sh | \
  ESP_HOST_BRIDGE_INSTALL_BREW_TOOLS=1 bash
```

## Run

Start the Web UI:

```bash
esp-host-bridge webui
```

On macOS, use the wrapper entrypoint so the Web UI and agent pick up the macOS-specific overrides:

```bash
esp-host-bridge-mac webui
```

Open:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8654`

## Service Control

For Ubuntu installs created by `install-ubuntu.sh`:

```bash
sudo systemctl status esp-host-bridge.service
sudo systemctl restart esp-host-bridge.service
sudo systemctl stop esp-host-bridge.service
sudo systemctl start esp-host-bridge.service
```

For macOS installs created by `install-mac.sh`:

```bash
launchctl list | rg com.rog713.esp-host-bridge
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rog713.esp-host-bridge.plist
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rog713.esp-host-bridge.plist
```

Manual foreground run on macOS without the LaunchAgent:

```bash
~/Applications/esp-host-bridge/.venv/bin/esp-host-bridge-mac webui
```

## Basic use

1. Open the Web UI.
2. Select the serial port for the ESP device.
3. Save and start the agent.
4. Confirm metrics are updating.

More models for other devices will be added on MakerWorld soon.

[Parts list for the enclosure build](docs/bom.md)

Example ESPHome display YAMLs live in `Esphome/`.

Currently included:

- `Esphome/host-key.yaml`  
  Reference firmware for the Waveshare ESP32-S3 Touch AMOLED 1.64 display module: `https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-amoled-1.64.htm?srsltid=AfmBOopppFyoRNGVg7sU9AVSuBIu3uMtdbn12-0CVSDJoOAEmXg8uDph`  
  It is intended for standalone ESP Host Bridge installs, connects to the host over USB CDC, and renders the full local telemetry UI on the display.

## Notes

- The current UI and screensaver were reimplemented for this project rather than carried over from UniFi firmware. The design direction was informed by the original hardware/software aesthetic, but the ESPHome/LVGL implementation used here is specific to this project.
- The configuration file is created automatically on first run.
- The Web UI is the main way to manage settings.
- If you enable direct Web UI protection and forget the password, remove or edit the generated `config.json` and start again.
